**Hey, I'm Kateřina Odabaşı!**

## Introduction
I'm coming to you from Brno, Czechia, where I've been digging into the world of software quality engineering (QE). My work has taken me through cool place like Red Hat, and I've got a Master's in Computer Engineering from Brno University of Technology. 

I'm all about stuff automation, in Red Hat I am focused on test automation, be it through Python, Bash, Jenkins CI, Maven, Docker, Kubernetes, whatever fits to the task. As QE I am precise, dedicated to find automation solution which fits into the cost and time constraints. As part of my job I also collaborate with open-source community and I really enjoy that! But that's just one part of my story.

## Who am I
When I'm not exploring Python or machine learning (which I got really into during a career break), you'll find me hitting the running trails, getting my hands dirty with pottery, or exploring outdoors, especially the mountains.

Recently, I've picked up archery. It's a whole new ball game for me – aiming for precision, staying patient, and having a blast while at it. It's kind of like my approach to work: tackle each challenge head-on and keep pushing until I nail it.

## Conclusion
So, that's a bit about me. A tech enthusiast with a bit of creative flair and a good dose of outdoor adventure. Glad to meet you!

I'll be happy to get in touch, links to contact me are at the bottom of the page.
